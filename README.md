# OO Playlister

Fork/Clone/Download this repository

run `rspec` from the project root folder

## Objectives

1. Implement the necessary code in app/models to pass all rspec specs.

   It's recommended that you start off by implementing the "::reset_all"
   methods in the Artist, Song, and Genre classes. These methods are
   used by the test suite to reset the state of the application and
   all tests will fail before they are implemented.

   Additionally, you will find a class definition for the "Findable"
   module in "app/concerns".

2. run `ruby bin/cli.rb` and have a functioning app

Feel free to push your own repo or gist if you want me to look at it.

## Bonus

create a file called `bin/generate.rb` that will generate a static html
site for the playlister application. Check out `erb` and http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html
